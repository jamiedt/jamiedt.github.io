        RICHARD MILLE'S ENDLESS SUMMER INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE

        What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        The very first thing I paid attention to when interacting with the
        experience was the amount of time it took for the experience to fully
        load in. There was text telling me what percentage of the experience had
        been loaded, and it was fading in and out. This fading in and out
        reassured me that the website was still working and that nothing had
        crashed, and the percentage was also constantly updated, showing me that
        progress was being made. The loading overall took 1-2 minutes, my guess
        being that it was loading all the images withing the experience so that
        it would run smoothly without any gaps or missing info. While it was
        loading I had the time to take in the art style as the loading screen
        was very colourful and interesting, although in the end I switched tabs
        while it was still loading because I had already taken in all the
        information on the page, and it was only halfway finished. One thing I
        found interesting was the fact that I needed to shorten my window from
        one of the sides to create a portrait view of the website. It felt a bit
        strange not having it take up my whole screen, but I found the
        interactive element of the sunrise going up as the window was shortened
        entertaining and thought it was a clever way to involve this technical
        asset towards the story of the experience. I’m assuming that the smaller
        window might be to make the experience more compatible between phone and
        laptop so that they didn’t need to create 2 different versions with
        different dimensions.

        Spend two minutes with the experience and create a list of each of your
        discrete actions.
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        After spending two minutes with the experience, I created a list of each
        of my discrete actions in order.
        <br /><br />
        1. Press Start <br />2. Click next on the tutorial <br />3. Used mouse
        drag to look around the screen <br />4. Scrolled the wheel to go to next
        scene <br />5. Clicked on the hidden feature <br />6. Scroll the wheel
        <br />7. Click on the poetry button <br />8. Scroll the wheel a few more
        times to finish the tutorial <br />9. Went through all the scenes
        searching around the scenes and clicking on any hidden objects as well
        as prompting the poetry with the corresponding animation.

        What part of the experience did you spend the most time engaging with?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        When interacting with the experience I probably spent the most amount of
        my time searching around each individual scene as they were all
        beautifully illustrated and had many intricate details. I was also
        looking around to try and find the secret objects that were hidden
        around in the scenes which when clicked on, provokes a secret animation
        or feature. I found trying to find these hidden objects (that were
        outlined in a faint white line) very engaging and exciting for me and
        gave the website a deepened interactive experience.

        What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        My most common action when interacting with the experience was probably
        scrolling the wheel through the different scenes. The only way to move
        on and progress is to use the wheel at the bottom so the most common
        action I made was this because I wasn’t patient enough to read the
        poetry for every scene, and there were a lot of scenes.

        <h1 class="whitebox">The Goal</h1>
      </div>
    <div class="outerleft">
      <h2 class="whitebox lefttop">
        What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive
        experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        I believe the intended goal of the interactive experience is for
        marketing purposes. As much as it is an interactive piece of art, the
        experience ultimately ends by taking you to the Richard Mille website
        with their new summer collection of watches featuring the RM 07-01. The
        aim is to get viewers into the summery mood to have a greater chance of
        selling their product.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="outerright">
      <h2 class="whitebox righttop">
        How does the interactive experience communicate this primary goal?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        The experience immerses the user in a serene and engaging summer
        atmosphere and evokes feelings of relaxation and joy to try and uplift
        the mood and get the viewer in a mindful state to possibly buy one of
        their watches. There are also subtle, underlying hints that Richard
        Mille uses to guide the viewer into the realm of their watches. The
        scrolling through the scenes imitates the cog wheels on a watch turning,
        the use of time throughout the story to depict the different scenes
        directly relates to the time on a watch, and the colours they
        incorporate are all found in their latest summer collection of watches
        which they advertise after, when you finish the experience.

        What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with
        over time? (For how long and how many different times)
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        My impression of the experience is that it is mostly a one-time
        experience as it is an exploration type of interaction, and the story
        doesn’t change once you have completed it. You can most definitely go
        back and complete it again if you rushed or missed things, but you will
        be repeating actions and going over the same content. Depending on how
        in depth you go into the experience, it can last from around 5 minutes,
        if you’re in a rush, to around 20 minutes, if you’re taking in all the
        information in every scene, but I personally think it gets a bit
        repetitive if you stay on it for too long.

    <div class="outerright">
      <h2 class="whitebox righttop">
        How does the interactive experience communicate how it should be
        interacted with over time?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        The experience encourages viewers to take it slow with many scenes that
        have a focus on relaxation like people doing yoga or a person relaxing
        in a hammock by the beach. The soundtrack has a slow BPM and plays
        calming music, advocating for a loose playthrough. At the end, the
        website also allows the user to share their experience, indicating that
        it is more of something that you complete, rather than something that
        you should come back to again and again.

        What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience
        reference?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        The experience draws from virtual worlds, interactive art installations,
        and ambient sound design typically seen in high-end digital experiences
        or interactive websites. It also has a touch of the kind of sleek and
        deluxe aesthetic found in other luxury lifestyle brands' campaigns.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should act
        when engaging with your research experience?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        The experience encourages a relaxed, open, and exploratory attitude.
        It's designed to be engaging and immersive, inviting you to spend time
        discovering its subtleties rather than rushing through it, with no clear
        objectives other than to enjoy the sensory journey.

        What does this reference/s communicate to you about how you should feel

      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        The design communicates that I should feel calm, intrigued, and
        inspired. The overall tone of the experience, coupled with the serene
        visuals and sounds, suggests a focus on enjoyment and mindfulness, which
        invites a more leisurely engagement.

        What is the most frustrating part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part frustrating?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox rightbot">
        For me the most frustrating part was the fact that I couldn’t have the
        experience in full screen. While it was a cool concept to make the
        viewer use a smaller window, it took a bit of immersion away from the
        experience as I had other tabs and my messy desktop in the background,
        distracting me from what I was doing. I would have felt a lot more
        satisfied if there was a way to full screen the website, even if the
        amount of interactive space stayed the same, for example, having the
        experience in the middle with just a flat colour or a gradient around
        the outside. /p>

        What is the most satisfying part of the interaction to you and what
        makes that part satisfying?
      </h2>
      <p class="whitebox leftbot">
        For me the whole experience is extremely satisfying with feel-good
        elements ranging from the smooth scrolling of the wheel at the bottom of
        the screen to the beautiful animation and colour palettes. My personal
        favourite part was the little secret interactions and animations that
        you could find and click on as it gave me a sense of adventure and
        journey as well as a reward for finding the hidden element.
